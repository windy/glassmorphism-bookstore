# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT add Administrator data here!
# Administrator accounts should be created manually or through separate admin setup commands.
# This seeds file is only for application data (products, categories, etc.)

# Write your seed data here
