Description:
    Generate a complete authentication system with users, sessions, and related functionality.
    This generator creates models, controllers, views, mailers, and migrations needed for
    a robust authentication system using modern Rails features.

Examples:
    # Generate full authentication system
    bin/rails generate authentication

    Note: This generator creates a complete authentication system with all features.
    If you don't need certain features (like OAuth, email verification, etc.),
    you can manually remove the corresponding files after generation.

Generated Features:
    - User registration and authentication
    - Session management with device tracking
    - Password management (change password)
    - Email verification (unless skipped)
    - Password reset via email (unless skipped)
    - Omniauth integration (unless skipped)
    - User invitation system
    - Mailer templates with HTML formatting
    - Modern UI using DaisyUI/Tailwind CSS

Post-Generation Steps:
    1. Run: rails db:migrate
    2. Add bcrypt gem to your Gemfile if not already present
    3. Configure your mailer settings for email functionality
    4. If using omniauth, configure providers in config/initializers/omniauth.rb
    5. Customize views to match your application's design
    6. Review generated code and adjust as needed
